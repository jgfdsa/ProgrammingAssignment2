## As a part of the course R programming, assignment 2:
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

## makeCacheMatrix; based on the example "Caching the Mean of a Vector and
## creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a functionto
##      1. set the value of the vector
##      2. get the value of the vector
##      3. set the value of the mean
##      4. get the value of the mean


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
